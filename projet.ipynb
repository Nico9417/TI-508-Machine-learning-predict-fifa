    "\n",
    "All 3 of us are passionate about football, so we decided to combine our shared passion with our IT skills in this project. In fact, from a computer point of view, football players can be seen as objects with precise statistics that reflect their ability. That's how we came up with the hypothesis that these statistics could be used as factors to determine their role on the pitch. For example, a player with good shooting ability would seem to be an attacker, just as a player who could easily intercept balls would be a defender.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have these observations, we can start to imagine a machine learning model that can guess a player's position as a defender, striker or midfielder. So here we have our features, which we'll abbreviate as ATT, DEF, MID. To carry out our project we have found on this <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nyagami/ea-sports-fc-25-database-ratings-and-stats?select=male_players.csv\">link</a>, a database containing all the professional football players with their statistics and their position. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help us develop this model, we will use the pandas, numpy, sklearn and matplotlib packages."

Through a methodical approach ranging from data preparation to model selection and evaluation, we have successfully exploited raw statistics to effectively rank football players according to their position on the pitch. This approach highlights the importance of data manipulation, the selection of relevant characteristics and the rigorous evaluation of models in order to obtain reliable and exploitable results."
